The Notes App is a simple web application built using React.js that allows users to create, edit, and manage their notes digitally. This project serves as an example of how to create a responsive and user-friendly notes-taking application using modern web development technologies.

### Features
1. Create Notes: Users can easily create new notes by clicking on the "New Note" button. This opens a blank note where they can start typing their content.

2. Edit Notes: Each note is fully editable. Users can click on a note to open it in edit mode and make changes to the content.

3. Delete Notes: If a user no longer needs a particular note, they can delete it using the "Delete" button associated with each note.

4. Save Automatically: The app automatically saves changes to notes as users type. There's no need to manually save, ensuring that no work is lost.

5. Responsive Design: The Notes App is designed to work seamlessly across various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices, providing a consistent user experience.

-- Technologies Used
React.js: The core framework used to build the user interface and manage the components' state with javascript.

LocalStorage: The browser's localStorage is used to store and retrieve notes locally on the user's device.

CSS: Custom CSS styles are applied to create an attractive and user-friendly interface.
